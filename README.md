# BotDMSpammer

## This was meant for NEXO but he wanna play around so here's the source I made for him

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Intructions
Download the zip (or git clone it if your on linux) and go to the directory on your Command Prompt or bash terminal. Then type in `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Once that is complete, put the main token you want to control all the slave bots in main.py. Once you have completed all that, you may do `py main.py`. Any issues go in the issues tab, and a PR (pull request) if you have one too :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Commands:
#### /checkbots: Check the amount of tokens (OWNER ONLY i think)
#### /addbot (token): add's bot onto the txt file (OWNER ONLY)
#### /addowner (user): add's the user as an owner (OWNER ONLY, also broken i think. if it doesn't work turn into normal prefix command and use user id)
#### /mass (user) (optional delay): Mass spam someone with all the tokens (bot or non bot)
#### /reload: reload's all the cogs (slash commands, OWNER ONLY)
#### /say: say anything through the bot (OWNER ONLY)
