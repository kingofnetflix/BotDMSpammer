## This was meant for NEXO (Nabeel Kocher, itsnexo1 on discord) but he wanna play around so here's the source I made for him

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Commands:
### /checkbots: Check the amount of tokens (OWNER ONLY i think)
### /addbot (token): add's bot onto the txt file (OWNER ONLY)
### /addowner (user): add's the user as an owner (OWNER ONLY, also broken i think. if it doesn't work turn into normal prefix command and use user id)
### /mass (user) (optional delay): Mass spam someone with all the tokens (bot or non bot)
### /reload: reload's all the cogs (slash commands, OWNER ONLY)
### /say: say anything through the bot (OWNER ONLY)
